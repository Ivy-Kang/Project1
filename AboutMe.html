	<h1>Hi, I am Minjeong (Ivy) Kang</h1>
	  <p>Hi class! My name is Minjeong Kang, but I prefer Ivy. I was born and raised in Korea, and it has been seven years since I came to the United States. I went to high school in Seattle, Washington, for three years and four years in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
	  <p>Here are some pictures of Korea</p>

	  <p>I had never been to the States before I came to Seattle, so it gives me special feelings about Seattle. It is almost my second hometown.</p>
	    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
		  <p>I love shopping, watching movies and TV shows, and lying in bed. Most of the times, I watch YouTube and use Disney Plus or Max for some movies and dramas. Ever since I came to the States, I started doing my nails because it was too expensive for the quality. I can spend the whole day just doing self-nails. Watching my favorite tv shows while doing my nails is my most 'therapeutic' hobby.</p>
