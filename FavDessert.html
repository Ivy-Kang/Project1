	  <p>Yakgwa is a traditional Korean sweet pastry that is fried and coated in syrup (Jupcheong) with flavors of ginger and honey.</p> 
	  <p>It was considered an expensive dessert (King's dessert) in the past, so our ancestors couldn't eat it very often. It was a rare dessert that can be had on special holidays such as Chuseok (harvest day), marriage, and New Year.</p> 
	  <p>It was made with many different shapes. But the most common shape is a flattened flower shape that started from the Joseon era to stack better.</p>

	  <p>This is one of my favorite Korean desserts. It is very chewy and sweet, which also goes well with vanilla ice cream.</p>

	  <p>Since Yakgwa became popular again in Korea, many different desserts started to appear with Yakgwa, such as Yakgwa cookies, Yakgwa chips, Yakgwa cake, etc.</p>
